#!/bin/bash

# Two commands are widely used for printing a custom message through script.
# 1. printf
# 2. echo

# Printf needs a lot of syntaxes and echo avoids them, Yet both does the same job.
# Hence we go with echo command

# echo INPUT

echo Hello World
echo Welcome to DevOps Training

# To print multi line outputs we need to enable escape sequences \n
# Syntax: echo -e "Hello\nWorld"
# when we use -e option then give input in quotes, Preferably double quotes

echo -e "Hello\nWorld"
echo -e "Hello\n\nWorld"

# Color based printing

# Colors      Code

# Red         31
# Green       32
# Yellow      33
# Blue        34
# Magenta     35
# Cyan        36

# Reset       0
# Bold        1

# Syntax: echo -e  "\e[COLCODEmMESSAGE"

echo -e "\e[31mHello in Red\e[0m"
echo -e "\e[1;31mHello in Bold Red\e[0m"

echo  "++++++++++++++  We are done with Printing Options ++++++++++++++++++"
